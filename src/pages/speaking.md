I spoke at my first conference in 2003, and my last in 2022. I co-founded the annual [Smidig](https://www.smidig.no/) (Agile) conference in Oslo in 2008, and organised 6-7 Cucumber confernces in the 2010s. I don't have a full list of all the presentations I have given, but below you can see one of them:
