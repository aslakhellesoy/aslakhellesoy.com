I have lost track of how many programming languages, frameworks and platforms I have worked with during my career.

I don't love any of them, although I do hate some of them, but at the end of the day they are just tools. I choose the best tool for the job depending on context:

* Will it help us go faster?
* Can we maintain what we build on it over time?
* Will it be around tomorrow?
* Is it testable?
* Can the rest of the team work with it?
* Have the LLMs been trained on it?
* Is it enjoyable to work with?

## Languages

The list goes on. I started my career doing a lot of Java. Then a lot or Ruby. I've done a fair amount of .NET and Go. Over the past 10 years mostly JavaScript and then TypeScript. I've played with Rust. And of course HTML, CSS and SQL. 

## Frameworks

I have worked with Spring, Ruby on Rails, Next.js, SvelteKit, Astro and many more that I don't remember.

## Platforms

I was an early adopter of serverless, building systems on AWS Lambda, later Step Functions. Since ca 2022 I keep coming back to Cloudflare (workes, durable objects, workflows etc). A recent favourite of mine is Temporal for massively scalable workflows.
