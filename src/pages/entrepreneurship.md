I have co-founded several companies.

## 2013: Cucumber Ltd

I co-founded Cucumber Ltd wiht Matt Wynne and Julien Biezemand, later joined by Seb Rose, Steve Tooke and Salyann Freudenberg. 

We delivered corporate training in Behaviour-Driven Development for product owners, business analysts, developers and testers. 

During those years we worked with over a hundred companies in the US and Europe, and also built a commercial tool around Cucumber, the open source project I founded in 2008.

Cucumber Ltd was acquired by SmartBear in 2019.

## 2022 Open Art Market

I co-founded Open Art Market Eivind Ingebrigtsen and Morten Viskum to build a marketplace to democratise art investment.

In 2024, Open Art Market opened its first gallery in Oslo, and we have over 250 investors and 50+ artworks.

## 2025: Papyria

With the rise of AI, I have co-founded a new company that specialises in bespoke AI solutions. More about this later...
