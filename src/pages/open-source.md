I first got involved in the Open Source community in 2001. I have created several open source projects that have been (and still are) used by hundreds of thousands (perhaps millions) of people around the world.

Open Source has been a big part of my career. It has introduced me to hundreds of people from whom I have learned *a lot*. It has opened my eyes to new technologies, and landed me a few jobs. I have spoken at numerous [conferences](/speaking) about them, but most of all it's been fun and rewarding.

Here is what I have worked on:

## Cucumber - 2008-2023

I created [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) in 2008. You can read the full story [here](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Cucumber-tool-for-BDD-named-as-such).

Cucumber eventually grew into a [company](/entrepreneurship) I co-founded, and is now living its own life under the [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/cucumber). It was downloaded [100M times](https://cucumber.io/sponsors) in 2024.

## EventSource - 2012-2017

I created [EventSource](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventsource) - an implementation of the [W3C](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html#the-eventsource-interface) standard for Node.js in 2012.

As of 2025 this library is downloaded [11M each week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eventsource) 
and has seen a recent rise in popularity because LLM APIs use the EventSource standard.

The EventSource library is used in the [Typescript SDK for Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/)

## RSpec - 2004-2007

I was one of the first contributors to [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) - the first popular BDD tool.

RSpec pioneered the concept of using `describe("the thing")` and `it("should do this thing")` which has made it into dozens of other testing tools over the years. (It was Dan North's idea).

## PicoContainer - 2003-2006

I created [PicoContainer](http://picocontainer.com/) in 2003 with Paul Hammant.

PicoContainer pioneered the ideas behind [dependency injection](https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) (before Spring) - a software pattern for loosely coupled and testable software.

## Webbit - 2012-2016

Back in 2012 when WebSockets were new, Joe Walnes created the [Webbit](http://webbitserver.org/) - one of the first Java Web servers with WebSocket support. He handed over the maintenance of the project to me in 2012. It was widely used inside DRW trading where we both worked at the time.

## XDoclet - 2001-2003

XDoclet was an escape-hatch from EJB hell back at the beginning of the 2000s. It helped me land a job in ThoughtWorks where I first got introduced to XP and more open source.
