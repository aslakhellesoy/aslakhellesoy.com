When I work with a client or join a company I often find myself out of depth in the domain they operate.

I realised quite early in my carreer that I have to understand the problem domain before I can offer a solution.

Then I realised that the domain experts and business people often struggle to articulate how the organisation works to software teams. There is often a deep chasm between them.

## Techniques

Every organisation is different, and each of them have a different set of problems.

Still, I keep coming back to the same tools and techniques to discover and understand these problems. -Not only for myself, but for the whole organisation so they can prioritise better and communicate better with software teams and other stakeholders. These techniques are:

- Event Storming
- Impact Mapping
- Wardley Mapping
- Example Mapping
- User Story Mapping
- Living Documentaion
